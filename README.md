## About Moneyar

-----------
Moneyar is an app made to help people to manage their personal finance. 

Nothing is started yet. Even our todo isn't done. We are focusing on creating a MVP version on this.

We will publish soon a complete roadmap (probably a Trello Board) where everyone will be able to comments and put thumbs-up to help us to prioritize the developpement.
